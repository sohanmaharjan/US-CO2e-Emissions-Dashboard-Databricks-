# Databricks Beginner rawdata-to-dashboard  Project
This project was created to build foundational skills in Databricks, including data ingestion, SQL analysis, and dashboard creation. Using emissions data, I explored how to upload files, create tables, run queries, and generate visual insights.

## What I Learned
-  How to upload CSV and JSON files into Databricks

-  Creating tables using the Databricks GUI and SQL

-  Running Python and SQL in Databricks Notebooks

-  Exploring data using SQL (cleaning, aggregations, calculations)

-  Building simple dashboards with maps, bar charts, scatter plots, and pie charts

-  Understanding Databricks File System (DBFS) and workspace navigation


## Project Output
-  Cleaned and queried dataset

-  Four dashboard visualizations created from the tables that were directly from SQL queries

## Tech Stack
Databricks,
SQL / Python,
DBFS,
Databricks Dashboards
